This is the Hotel website project.
This website is developed using bootstrap & to add designs and make it more attractive we used 
jss to make it as best as we can. Different photos are included to give customers about the hotel.
In this project, we develop a web page for a hotel management site that includes the type of 
rooms.
Different types of rooms are categorized under one section of the web page, check-in and 
checkout options are available we can online book the rooms and after any further query, we can 
modify or drop our room type or our booking.
And also it includes the address and contact number of members of the hotel if there is any issue 
is there for customers can easily contact and resolve their issue
